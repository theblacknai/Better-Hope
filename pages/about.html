			<div id="about">
				Betterhope Foundation is a youth based NGO, an offshoot of community development service in Kano State, Northern Nigeria; during the 2010/2011 one year compulsory national youth service for graduates. After designing the award winning projects to be executed within the service year; the cost implication was enough discouragement to abort the dream. 
				There was no going back. Thinking on how to make it happen inspired the big picture of hope for young people across Africa
 									<i>â€“ BETTERHOPE FOUNDATION.</i>
				<br>    
				However, the terms of community development projects for the scheme was meant to be personal and not corporate, so the name BETTERHOPE FOUNDATION, never showed up during the service year, but it became the driving force that made the adventure, not just fruitful, but fulfilling
				The incorporation process began in August 2010 in Kano State Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). Eventually when the name was approved for registration, there was no fund to complete the process. At another attempt, the CAC said the name was no longer available for registration. The name was reviewed and resubmitted, it came out for registration, but the process was halted due to lack of fund. 
				<br>
				The circle continued, but hope kept the dream alive and finally in July 2018, it was incorporated as OGBONNAYAEKE  BETTERHOPE FOUNDATION. From 2010 to date, programmes kept unfolding, inspiring hopes and helping young people live their dreams in schools, churches, NYSC camps, NCCF, small groups and one on one coaching. So far, we have impacted over 6,000 young people across Nigeria and it is getting better and bigger by the day.
